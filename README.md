# HN-Bored

## Description

Hn-go is an API based on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com) created by [ycombinator](https://www.ycombinator.com)

- I built this project to have a more accessible API for HN
- This project ingests and creates a local cache of http response data from HN's firebase API.
- Using this code structure, I focused on cleaning up the responses to be friendlier for clients to parse with minimal fetching.
- Learned concepts: Chunked API responses, local caching structures
